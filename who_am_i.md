I guess this is sort of a short virtual CV explaining what I have done so far in my life. As with most CVs I will do my best to sell myself asa great constructive 
member of society! Sit tight cause this will be rather... underwhelming.

## Education
### Cyber Security MSc - York University (2020 - 2021)
Due to start at the end of September. Modules are meant to start online due to the COVID-19 pandemic.


### Computer Science BSc - University of Leeds (2017 - 2020)
During my studies at the university of Leeds I found out that I was actually a big fan of programming and of computers in general. Some would say that I should have come to that conclusion before starting my degree, but to each their own. Through my degree I developed my analytical skills and my general understanding of mathematics and of computers as a whole. I graduated with a 1:1.

Some of the modules I took which I found especially interesting were, in no specific order:

  - Databases

  - Computer Processors

  - Networks

  - Distributed Systems

  - Secure Computing
