I guess this is sort of a short virtual CV explaining what I have done so far in my life. As with most CVs I will do my best to sell myself asa great constructive member of society! Sit tight cause this will be rather... underwhelming.


## Education
### Computer Science BSc - University of Leeds (2017-2020)
During my studies at the university of Leeds I found out that I was actually a big fan of programming and of computers in general. Some would say that I should have come to that conclusion before starting my degree, but to each their own. Through my degree I developed my analytical skills and my general understanding of mathematics and of computers as a whole.

Some of the modules I took which I found especially interesting were, in no specific order:

>> [Databases]

>> [Computer Processors]

>> [Networks]

>> [Distributed Systems]

>> [Secure Computing]
