I guess this is sort of a short virtual CV explaining what I have done so far in my life. As with most CVs I will do my best to sell myself asa great constructive 
member of society! Sit tight cause this will be rather... underwhelming.

## Certifications
### eJPT - eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester (June 2020)
[Certificate PDF](./resources/Your_ejpt_certificate.pdf) 

The eJPT taught me some interesting concepts of penetration testing. I learned a lot about the specifics of the OSI model and also learned about pivoting and enumerating an unknown 'black box'. I completed the eJPT on my first attempt.

## Education
### Cyber Security MSc - York University (2020 - 2021)
Due to start at the end of September. Modules are meant to start online due to the COVID-19 pandemic.


### Computer Science BSc - University of Leeds (2017 - 2020)
During my studies at the university of Leeds I found out that I was actually a big fan of programming and of computers in general. Some would say that I should have come to that conclusion before starting my degree, but to each their own. Through my degree I developed my analytical skills and my general understanding of mathematics and of computers as a whole.

Some of the modules I took which I found especially interesting were, in no specific order:

  - Databases

  - Computer Processors

  - Networks

  - Distributed Systems

  - Secure Computing
