### >> BLE Beacons in the Office - Android:  [Github link](https://github.com/danielperez660/IndividualProject)
* * *
My final year project for my Computer Science BSc. Uses an android based system to interface with Slack. This system allows the application to send a message into a Slack channel any time that the user passes through a set of beacons which are to be placed at the entrance of the office. The entire report on the test carried out and the implementation process can be found here: [report](./resources/PEREZ-CASCON20-FINAL.pdf).

### >> Flask Multi API System - Python:  [Github link](https://github.com/danielperez660/rest_python_flask)
* * *
Coursework for a distributed systems module, uses 3 different REST API's to contribute to one central web app. One of the API's is developed by me and can also be found in the repository.

### >> Django Teacher Assessment System - Python:  [Github link](https://github.com/danielperez660/Django_API)
* * *
Django based rating system for teachers. This system only functions for a given scenario and so lacks robustness. 
<br><br>

### >> Basic Website Crawler and Browser - Python:  [Github link](https://github.com/danielperez660/Crawler-and-search-engine)
* * *
Very basic web crawler and browser system. This system allows you to crawl a specific website and saves the key words in a weighted inverted index. It later allows you to search for specific terms and returns a url based on the frequency and position of the term in the given web page. This system is again only meant as a PoC and so its regex for parsing is very centred around the website in the scenario.
<br><br>

### >> TkInter and CLI Based Rock Paper Scissors - Python:  [Github link](https://github.com/danielperez660/Rock_Paper_Scissors)
* * *
Very simple rock paper scissors game that I used to introduce myself to python very early on in my programming career.
Implemented to be used in the command line and also with a GUI.
