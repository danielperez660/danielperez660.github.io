### BLE Beacons in the Office - Android:  [Github link](https://github.com/danielperez660/IndividualProject)
* * *
My final year project for my Computer Science BSc. Uses an android based system to interface with Slack. This system allows the application to send a message into a Slack channel any time that the user passes through a set of beacons which are to be placed at the entrance of the office. The entire report on the test carried out and the implementation process can be found here: [report](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Ag57HCdArCWDhW6kbyK3UGNJR8O1?e=kfu9jM).
